            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming Education In India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
                purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with
                classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the
                subject. It can be subdivided into various categories or levels. The International Standard
                Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a statistical base to compare education
                systems. In 1997, it defined seven levels of education and 25 fields, though the fields were later
                separated out to form a different project. The current version ISCED 2011 has nine rather than seven
                levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. It also extended the
                lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood educational development programs,
                which target children below the age of three years.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">University education includes teaching, research, and social services
                activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as tertiary education)
                and the graduate (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as graduate school). Some universities
                are composed of several colleges.
                <br></br>
                One type of university education is a liberal arts education, which can be defined as a "college or
                university curriculum aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual
                capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum." Although what is
                known today as liberal arts education began in Europe, the term "liberal arts college" is more
                commonly associated with institutions in the United States such as Williams College or Barnard College.
